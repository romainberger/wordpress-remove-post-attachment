Adds a "detach from post" link on attachments so you can remove it from the post without deleting the file.

== Description ==

Adds a "detach from post" link on attachments so you can remove it from the post without deleting the file.

Wordpress doesn't give a simple way to add links in the media lightbox, so this plugin does its thing in a pretty hacky way. If it stops working or if you see any issue, please create an issue precising the Wordpress version you're using.

== Installation ==

Simply upload the plugin (as a zip) from the extension page.

== Screenshots ==
